# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Examining the IMDB rating and focusing on the mean ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, we initially reproduced the given plot before doing further calculations to determine the validity of the comparison.

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Reproducing the graph and running hypothesis tests on the differences between ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton: 

Our null and alternate hypotheses are:

H0: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is equal to zero
H1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero

Initial data analysis reveals the following:

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
#glimpse(movies) - did not want to run this in the knit

#round values up to 3 decimals
options(digits=4)

#Cleaning the data and removing the unnecessary columns 

movies_clean <- movies %>% 
  filter((director=="Steven Spielberg")|(director=="Tim Burton")) %>% 
  subset(select=c("director","rating"))

#Calculating variables required for Confidence Intervals

mean_ratings <- movies_clean %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ratings=mean(rating),
            count_director= count(director),
            stdev_ratings=sd(rating)) 

#Computing standard error and confidence intervals

ci_director <- mean_ratings %>% 
  mutate(se_director=stdev_ratings/sqrt(count_director),
         lower_ci=mean_ratings-1.96*se_director,
         upper_ci=mean_ratings+1.96*se_director,
         
#reorder the directors to appear Spielberg on top in the chart
         director=fct_reorder(director,desc(stdev_ratings)))
ci_director

#defining colors for error bars
ci_colors <- c("#09bec3", "#f7746b")
  
#Visualising the data
ci_chart <- ggplot()+
                    
  geom_errorbar(ci_director,mapping=aes(x=director, 
                                        ymin=lower_ci, 
                                        ymax=upper_ci),
                                        width=0.05,
                                        size=2,
                                        color=ci_colors)+
  geom_point(ci_director, mapping=aes(x=director,
                                        y=mean_ratings),
                                        size=4,
                                        color=ci_colors)+
  #geom_text(aes(label=???))+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_rect()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",subtitle = "95% Confidence intervals overlap",x="",y="Mean IMDB Rating")+
  geom_rect(aes(NULL,NULL,xmin=0,xmax=2.75),
            ymin=7.290,ymax=7.298, colour="white", size=0.5, alpha=0.2)
ci_chart
```

Examining the graph, we cannot draw any final conclusion, as the overlap in the confidence intervals is minor - this will require some further investigation

```{r}
#Calculating the difference in means
diff_means <- movies_clean %>% 
  specify(rating~director) %>% 
  calculate("diff in means",
            oder=c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))

#Simulating null distribution
spielberg_burton_null <- movies_clean %>% 
  specify(rating~director) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 5000) %>% 
  calculate("diff in means",
            oder=c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))

#Visualising the simulated distribution 
spielberg_burton_null %>% 
  visualize(obs_stat = diff_means) + 
  labs(x = "Difference in mean rating\n(Spielberg - Burton)",
       y = "Count",
       subtitle = "Red line shows observed difference in mean") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

The red line is pretty far in the right tail of the distribution and seems atypical. We can calculate the probability of seeing a difference as big as 0.64 by using the get_pvalue function

```{r}

#Calculating the p value
spielberg_burton_null %>% 
 get_pvalue(obs_stat = diff_means, direction = "both")

```

The p value of 0.0104 which indicates that there is a probability of 1.04% to observe a difference in means of the ratings as large as 0.64. 
Therefore, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the IMDB ratings of the two directors, with higher ratings for Steven Spielberg than Tim Burton. We can now reject the Null hypothesis.

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

To look at the differences in GDP accross countries, we have focussed on Germany, India, and USA. In order to gain a better understanding of their components and trends, we have sorted, cleaned, and filtered the data before plotting the relevant data points in the charts that follow:


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

To make the data easier to handle, we have changed the figures, renamed the indicators and pivoted the data.

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

#Pivoting the data and dividing the numbers
tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(!c(CountryID,Country,IndicatorName),names_to="years", values_to="amount") %>%
  mutate(amount=amount/1e9)

#Assigning new names to indicator types
new_names <- c("Final consumption expenditure"="Final_Consumption",
               "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" = "Household_Expenditure",
               "General government final consumption expenditure" = "Government_Expenditure",
               "Gross capital formation" = "Gross_Capital_Formation",
               "Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)" = "Fixed_Capital_Formation",
               "Exports of goods and services" = "Exports",
               "Imports of goods and services" = "Imports",
               "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" = "GDP",
               "Agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing (ISIC A-B)" = "Agriculture, FOrestry, Hunting",
               "Mining, Manufacturing, Utilities (ISIC C-E)" = "Mining_Manufacturing_Utilities",
               "Manufacturing (ISIC D)" = "Manufacturing",
               "Construction (ISIC F)" = "Construction",
               "Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels (ISIC G-H)" = "Wholesale_Retail_Hospitality",
               "Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I)" = "Transport_Storage_Communication",
               "Other Activities (ISIC J-P)" = "Other",
               "Total Value Added" = "Total_Value")

tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName <- as.character(new_names[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName])
```

Reproducing the given plot yields the following result:

```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r,fig.height=6, fig.width=9.25}

# Defining the list of countries to compare
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

#Indicators required to reproduce the graph
indicator_list <- c("Gross_Capital_Formation","Exports", "Government_Expenditure","Household_Expenditure", "Imports")


#Creating a smaller dataframe for the relevant countries, removing the ID column, filtering for required indicators
comparison_countries <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName %in% indicator_list) %>% 
  select(!CountryID)

ggplot(comparison_countries,aes(x=years,
                                y=amount,
                                group=IndicatorName,
                                color=IndicatorName))+
  geom_line(size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c("1970","1980","1990","2000","2010"))+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time", subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD", col="Components of GDP",y="Billion US$",x="")


```

To double check the given GDP data, we have manually calculated the GDP with the components Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). There are slight differences between our calculations and those given in the UN dataframe.


```{r,fig.height=6, fig.width=12.5}
options(digits=3)
options(scipen=999)


#Including GDP in the indicators list
indicator_list_2 <- c("GDP","Gross_Capital_Formation","Exports", "Government_Expenditure","Household_Expenditure", "Imports")


#Creating a smaller dataframe for the relevant countries, removing the ID column, filtering for required indicators
ratio_components <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName %in% indicator_list_2) %>% 
  select(!CountryID) %>%
  
#Putting data into wide format in order to perform calculations (create GDP_new + proportions)
  pivot_wider(names_from = "IndicatorName",values_from="amount") %>% 
  mutate("net_exports"= Exports - Imports,
         "GDP_new"=Gross_Capital_Formation+
                   Government_Expenditure+ 
                   Household_Expenditure+ 
                   net_exports,
         "GDP_diff"= (GDP_new-GDP)/GDP,
         "Gross capital formation"=Gross_Capital_Formation/GDP_new,
         "Government Expenditure"=Government_Expenditure/GDP_new,
         "Household Expenditure"= Household_Expenditure/GDP_new,
         "Net Exports"=net_exports/GDP_new) %>% 
  
#Putting data back to long, tidy format
  select(1:2,11:15) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c("Gross capital formation",
                      "Government Expenditure",
                      "Household Expenditure",
                      "Net Exports"),
               names_to="IndicatorName",
               values_to="GDP_proportions")


#Analyzing difference between GDP in dataframe (GDP) and newly calculated GDP (GDP_new)
GDP_difference <- ratio_components %>% 
  select(1:3) %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarize(min_diff= min(GDP_diff)*100,
            mean_diff= mean(GDP_diff)*100,
            max_diff= max(GDP_diff)*100)

```


After manually calculating the GDP from the data provided, we observe the following differences to the GDP provided as part of the dataset:

Germany: Annual differences to GDP ranging from -0.41% to +3.56%, with the mean difference +1.14% 

India: Annual differences to GDP ranging from -6.35% to +7.41%, with the mean difference +0.19%

United States: Annual differences to GDP ranging from -0.05% to +4.55%, with the mean difference +1.27%

The initial analysis of the chart reveals the following observations:  

Examining the chart, we observe the following: 
Comparing all three countries, one can see that the ratios of the components making up GDP are the most stable in Germany, followed by the United States, and then India. This is to be expected as Germany and the US could be considered very developed, stable economies, while India represents a fast growing, dynamic, emerging economy.

Germany:
Most notably, the net exports have risen in Germany over the period starting in 2000, while capital formation and household consumption have decreased to compensate for this. Taking a closer look at the data reveals that this trend is driven by exports growing at a higher rate than imports. Considering Germany’s GDP has grown (in absolute terms) since 2000, it may be interesting to examine whether individual components have stagnated or if all have grown, albeit as very different rates. Despite the (almost) continuous absolute growth of GDP in Germany over the examined time period, the individual components of GDP and their ratios have remained constant.  

India: 
Most notably, one can observe that the most movement has occurred within Household expenditure and Gross capital formation since 2000. This may be expected in a fast growing, emerging economy, as more of the generated income is available to longer term investment, rather than short term consumption. These two components, since approximately 2000 have consistently and quickly moved in opposing directions (in terms of percentage points) until approximately 2015, when all indicators show stabilisation. Considering that GDP in absolute terms has been growing at rates in excess of 6% annually in the last years, it is interesting to note that government spending has kept pace, as indicated by a stable % contribution. This indicates a strong support of growth by the government through investment in infrastructure and other stimuli. 

USA: 
The GDP breakdown of the USA may best be characterised by a steady decrease in government expenditure, with a corresponding increase in household expenditure. Net exports have decreased, particularly since the late 90s, which is indicative of the move of manufacturing to other parts of the world, predominantly Asia. Interestingly, in the same time, net exports in Germany increased which shows that Germany was better able to maintain the value of its net exports, while the export output of the USA stagnated relative to imports.
