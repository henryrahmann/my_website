</code></pre><p>The initial analysis of the chart reveals the following observations:</p>
<p>Examining the chart, we observe the following: 
Comparing all three countries, one can see that the ratios of the components making up GDP are the most stable in Germany, followed by the United States, and then India. This is to be expected as Germany and the US could be considered very developed, stable economies, while India represents a fast growing, dynamic, emerging economy.</p>
<p>Germany:
Most notably, the net exports have risen in Germany over the period starting in 2000, while capital formation and household consumption have decreased to compensate for this. Taking a closer look at the data reveals that this trend is driven by exports growing at a higher rate than imports. Considering Germany’s GDP has grown (in absolute terms) since 2000, it may be interesting to examine whether individual components have stagnated or if all have grown, albeit as very different rates. Despite the (almost) continuous absolute growth of GDP in Germany over the examined time period, the individual components of GDP and their ratios have remained constant.</p>
<p>India: 
Most notably, one can observe that the most movement has occurred within Household expenditure and Gross capital formation since 2000. This may be expected in a fast growing, emerging economy, as more of the generated income is available to longer term investment, rather than short term consumption. These two components, since approximately 2000 have consistently and quickly moved in opposing directions (in terms of percentage points) until approximately 2015, when all indicators show stabilisation. Considering that GDP in absolute terms has been growing at rates in excess of 6% annually in the last years, it is interesting to note that government spending has kept pace, as indicated by a stable % contribution. This indicates a strong support of growth by the government through investment in infrastructure and other stimuli.</p>
<p>USA: 
The GDP breakdown of the USA may best be characterised by a steady decrease in government expenditure, with a corresponding increase in household expenditure. Net exports have decreased, particularly since the late 90s, which is indicative of the move of manufacturing to other parts of the world, predominantly Asia. Interestingly, in the same time, net exports in Germany increased which shows that Germany was better able to maintain the value of its net exports, while the export output of the USA stagnated relative to imports.</p>
